# Android setup
- this is assuming you have set up firebase and have created a new project
- first, create a new android studio project with no template
- Follow [this](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup) setup guide for your app. Important steps are highlighted below
  - Navigate to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
    - Click Add Firebase to your Android app
    - Then, enter your android project's package name, and click add app
    - you should have downloaded a google-services.json file, if not go to project settings and download it
      - you can get to project settings by pressing the gear icon next to overview in the nav
  - In android studio, you have to go to tools>android>SDK Manager and under the SDK tools tab make sure that you have installed:
    - Google Play Services
    - Google Repository
  - follow the gradle instructions exactly
- After you are done with this, you can copy the given manifest, source code, and the layout into your android project
  - you will likely have to update the class packages in the java files and in the AndroidManifest.xml file
  - you will need to put the layout folder into the res folder, but the colors and styles files inside res>values may not be necessary
- The phone's token will appear on the screen and will be printed to the console. This value is the <devices> value in envVar.js
- The <api_key> value can be found by going to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com), navigating to project settings, going to the cloud messaging tab, and coping the Server key.
- One important point is that you need to close and reopen the android app after initially installing it for the app to start receiving requests.
- Run the script.js file with node and you should get a push notification on your phone.
